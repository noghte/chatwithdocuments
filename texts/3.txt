Q:Can I have someone else obtain keys for a reservation on my behalf?
A:Yes, please include the person's name (faculty, staff or student) on the reservation online form in the appropriate field. Only the person designed to pick up the keys will be authorized to retrieve the key(s) from Key Control.
Q:If I do not need the reservation, can I give someone else the classroom to use?
A:No, please e-mail the Office of Course Scheduling and Reservations (OCS) at regreservation@gsu.edu to cancel. The person will need to submit a classroom reservation request of their own.
