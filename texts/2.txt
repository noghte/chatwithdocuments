Q:Can I repeat a course to replace a grade?
A:Yes.Undergraduate students who have retaken courses and earned a higher grade may request to have the first grade excluded from their institutional GPA under the Repeat-to-Replace policy. If the request is approved, the Office of the Registrar will make appropriate notations next to the original course on the student's official transcript. Grades for all attempts of the course will appear on the students official transcript. This policy has no effect on any GPA requirements set by state or federal laws/regulations (such as the GPA requirements set by the HOPE scholarship program). A copy of the request and approval will become part of the students permanent record file. The attempt to repeat must be made in fall 2011 or thereafter. Students who have repeated courses prior to this date will not be allowed to delete earlier attempts from their GPA calculation. Units may prohibit students from repeating certain courses regardless of whether or not the grade has been excluded from the students GPA.
